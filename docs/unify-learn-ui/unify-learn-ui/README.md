# Unify Learn · phone screens (React + TypeScript)

Every phone screen from the Figma file **Unify MoodBoard**, built in the same stack as `DIBBLS/unify` → `apps/web`
(React 18, React Router 6, lucide-react, Vite 5, TypeScript strict).

**102 screens:** student S01–S76, contributor C01–C06, lecturer L01–L20.
**Not included:** desktop, dark mode, Dean/HOD, Face-off (game).

The *why* behind each screen is in a separate doc: **Unify Learn · Why Each Screen Works This Way** (shared alongside this zip).

---

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3001
npm run build      # type-check + production build
```

- `/` opens a gallery of every screen, grouped like the Figma sections.
- `/screens/S19` opens one screen at phone width. A small bar (top right) steps through screens; arrow keys work too, `h` hides it. Add `?clean` to hide it for screenshots.
- Buttons inside screens move between screens the way the real app will.

## What changed from the earlier designs (all in code)

- **Semester week strip** (`SemesterWeek` in brand.tsx) sits in the Home hero, under the department pill.
  Weeks 1–7 calm (green), 8–10 amber "exams in N weeks", 11–12 red ("exams next week" at 12). No "first class" time.
- **CGPA plan (S15–S18):** the student enters their CGPA once. Compulsory courses are pre-ticked. Each course is only
  marked **Done / Priority / Not yet** (Priority = carryover). No per-course grades. Maths is in `neededGpa()` and
  `bestFinish()` in Home.tsx.
- **Box Boy picker (S11):** circular carousel: selected avatar in the middle, neighbours left/right fading out; swipe
  or tap to move; persona title and traits underneath ("The 5.0 Scholar").
- **Timetable colours:** one neutral style for every class. Colour only means status (red cancelled, amber dashed not
  confirmed, black moved).

## Porting into `apps/web`

1. Copy `styles/`, `components/`, `public/boxboy/` across. Import both CSS files once in the app entry.
2. Move screens over one flow at a time. Each screen is a plain component with no props; lift data into props or hooks.
3. Replace `useGo('S..')` with real routes (map below). `nav.ts` is the only place that knows about Figma ids.
4. Replace `data/sample.ts` with API calls. Every screen reads from it or from local constants marked as sample.
5. The current repo tabs are Dashboard/Learn/Explore/Profile (students) and Dashboard/Studio/Profile (authors).
   The designs use **Home / Timetable / Class / Me** for students and lecturers and **Home / Studio / Me** for
   contributors. `TabBar` in chrome.tsx has all three.

### Suggested route map

| Route | Screens |
|---|---|
| `/welcome`, `/signup/*` | S01–S13 |
| `/home` | S14, S19, S20, S58 |
| `/plan`, `/plan/courses`, `/plan/target`, `/plan/result` | S15–S18 |
| `/notifications` | S21 |
| `/course/:code` (`?tab=weeks\|outline\|practice`) | S23–S25, S60 |
| `/course/:code/week/:n/class/:c` | S26, S27 (report sheet) |
| `/course/:code/week/:n/quiz` (`/q/:i`, `/results`) | S28–S32 |
| `/course/:code/week/:n/done`, `/streak` | S33, S34 |
| `/revision`, `/revision/done` | S35, S36 |
| `/timetable` (`?view=week\|day`) | S37–S40 |
| `/class/:slotId` | S41, S64–S70 (online) |
| `/class` (feed) | S42, S43 |
| `/guides/:slug` | S44 |
| `/me`, `/me/edit`, `/me/settings`, `/me/settings/notifications` | S45–S49 |
| `/me/class-rep/request` | S50, S51 |
| `/rep/post`, `/rep/timetable`, `/rep/contributors` | S54–S56 |
| `/attendance/setup`, `/attendance/pass`, `/attendance/scan`, `/attendance` | S57, S59, S61, S63 |
| `/rep/confirm-lecturer/:id` | S62 |
| `/lecturer/profile/:id` | S53 |
| `/studio` (`/compose`, `/manual`, `/quiz`, `/review`, `/live`) | C01–C06 |
| `/l/onboarding/*` | L01–L06 |
| `/l/home`, `/l/timetable`, `/l/me` | L07–L09, L17 |
| `/l/course/:code` (`?tab=weeks\|report\|attendance`) | L10–L12 |
| `/l/review/:weekId`, `/l/send`, `/l/post` | L13–L15 |
| `/l/attendance/:sessionId` | L16 |
| `/l/online/:slotId` (`/live`, `/register`) | L18–L20 |

S52 (offline), S71–S76 (states) are states of other routes, not routes of their own.

## Behaviour notes for the build

- **Quiz (S29–S31):** copy and long-press are blocked while a quiz is open (`QuizShell`). One timer for the whole quiz;
  submits at zero. If the connection drops, answers save on the phone and submit later (S75).
- **Maths keypad (S31):** answers are checked as expressions, so `(8/27)ρV³` and `0.296ρV³` both count.
- **Attendance pass (S59):** placeholder pattern. Real pass = signed QR that rotates every 30 s and works offline for
  the day (S74 when it needs a refresh). Several Heads of Class can scan one class; offline scans queue (S61).
- **Online class (S64–S70, L18–L20):** big classes split into rooms of 100 (by surname, matric or evenly). Students
  always join through Unify so their room is assigned and check-in 1 is recorded. Present = 2 of 3 check-ins.
- **Notifications:** at most 3 a day; class changes always come through (S49).
- **Lecturer report (L11):** counts only. Names show only on attendance lists.

## Open item (don't build yet)

**Verified class list / claiming a matric number.** S57 collects full name + matric once, and the Head of Class sees
them on scan. How a student proves that name and matric are theirs (school email sign-in, the HOC's uploaded list,
forgotten passwords, linking a school email later) is still being decided. See the reasoning doc, section
"Attendance: open discussion".

## Assets

- Box Boy PNGs in `public/boxboy/` are 1× exports from Figma. Replace with the original high-res files before launch.
- Fonts load from Google Fonts (Bowlby One SC, Inter, Playfair Display, STIX Two Text). Self-host for offline use.
- Everything in `data/sample.ts` and the screen-level constants is sample content.
